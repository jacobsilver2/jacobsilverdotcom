export const welcome = 'I am a full stack web developer with a passion for React-specific projects, databases, and music with experience in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React. Booking over 200 concerts a month while remaining extremely busy as a self-employed musician inspired me to develop my own software and automation solutions, which led me to pursue a career in web development. I bring strong skills in project management, automation, and workflow planning. I have years of experience creating and managing workflows for entire teams to manage the complexities of a music venue. '
